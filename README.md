Under bonnet (hood) relay board for GM 5.7V8 TBI

I wanted a no frills plain Jane ECU for an American 4x4. The plan is to use the standard 8 pin GM HEI distributor and a two barrell TBI injection unit from a late eighties car or truck.
One etra that I did want was Can bus, this is mainly to allow engine perameters to be shown on an LCD touch screen mounted on the dashboard and to allow a separate PWM fan assembly to monitor engine temperature and possible wheel speed.
A pcb has been made using 2 Oz copper, this contains the rlays, fuses and connectors to allow for a tidy and reliable under hood instalation. The pcb has a socker and stand off pillars to accept a small circuit board to controll the torque converter lockup clutch (TCC)' currently this uses a simple opp amp with adjustable historesis, I might use the same circuit but transfer it to the relay board or may use a Attin85.
